  <p>I kept on bug correction while we are trying to pick a date between all these holidays buzz to discuss about the designs. Yeah, it sums up very well what was about my second week of outreachy.</p>

  <p>However there's something bugging me. No matter how hard I try to solve as much bugs as I can, I can't get rid of the feeling that I'm slow moving and the difference that I'm making it's in fact a very tiny part of all that Polari needs. I know that all those bugs to solve aren't there waiting to be solved by me (it isn't even the point of this internship). After thinking <s>and struggling</s> for a while I came to this: 
<ul>
	<li>I want to contribute more;</li>
	<li>I need to get better at contributing;</li>
</ul>
In fact, if I contribute more I'll get better at contributing. Likewise, If I get better at contributing I can contribute more. It's totally cyclic! The best thing about it? I already started! </p>
<p>For now this is the message that I leave <s>for my future self</s>: Just keep <s>swimming</s> doing the good work! See you soon earthlings!</p>
