<p>To be more specific, it was on August 12 â€“ 14 and took place in the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at Karlsruhe, Germany.
I had my first person-to-person experience of what a FOSS community is, almost all that people that I chatted-with during the Outreachy was there!</p>

The wide range of talks was surprising. I attended to tech-talks, FOSS community talks, security talks, UI talks, documentation talks, the annual GNOME reports and a free art talk. The organisation was remarkable, they planned everything very carefully, fast tackled eventual problems and left some space for even the most exceptional details (ice cream van! :D). </p>
<p>
    I had a chance to live-discuss ideas for some upcoming features of Polari, with Florian, Rares and Bastian. 
</p>
<p> 
    We had some evening activities as well, my favorite one was a cozy women's dinner where we openly shared perspectives, interests and experiences not only about the FOSS community.
