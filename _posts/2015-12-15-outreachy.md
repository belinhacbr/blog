  <p>So, I'm participating of the <a href="https://gnome.org/outreachy/">Outreachy program</a> from December/2015 to March/2016 and I'm all excited for this! Outreachy is a program for under-represented groups who would like to contribute to a free and open source software project. Seems pretty cool, yeh?</p>

  <p>During my internship I'll be working in <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Polari">Polari</a>, which is a GNOME's IRC chat client. The work that I plan to accomplish on Polari is the connection/join dialog redesign, which we must be discussing the definitive design soon.</p>

  <p>While the mockups aren't ready yet, at this first week, I was working on bug fixing and trying to catch up with <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>. At this point, GTK+ is a little bit challenging for me, because I particularly never worked with this widgets paradigm before and sometimes it's tricky, at least for me, to understand all those signal stuff. Although, I think this kind of feeling is pretty <s>human</s> normal and my mentor, Florian MÃ¼llner, is always there to help.</p>

  <p>At first I'll leave you with this. I intend to post here my thoughts about the program and project progress at a reasonable rate. See you soon earthlings!</p>
