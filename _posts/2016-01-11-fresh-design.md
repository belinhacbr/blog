<p>In my latest post I talked about being ready to implement some fresh mockups. 
But they were not ready at that time. Although there was a certain effort do finish the designs before the new year's eve, it couldn't be done.</p>
<p>Now that the holidays have passed and the lifes are back on track, I finally have a mockup to show you of a feature that I'm going to implement! Yay!<p>

<p>So, I'm going to redesign the connection dialog in order to provide easier feedback about the connection.</p>
<p>Since I've got a lot of work to I'm gonna leave you with this. See you soon earthlings!<p>
