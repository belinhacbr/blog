<p>With the join dialog pre-review patch released, I was expecting to make some changes when I received the feedback from the review but the requested review would change waaay more than I expected.</p>
<p>Reasonably, most of the changes was refactoring for a better functional cohesion and others for the UI scheme, which happened most, of course, because of my lack of expertise. 
It doesn't seem to be much, but it took me a week and thousands of revisions to finally get a nice and satisfactory patch.</p>
<p>After all those reviews, there was still some work to do at the same feature, things that I didn't predict while developing and for my luck, at least most of the times, somebody else pointed out.</p>
<p>This whole experience made me value the FOSS process of development and its code quality in a way that I haven't thought before Outreachy. 
All the changes that I made are agreed, explained and documented. ALL. OF. THEM. Which is pretty reasonable, since it's a software that can be accessed by anybody. 
Most of the professional development experiences that I had, never got even close to that process and believe me, it wasn't because of the lack of trying. </p>
<p>I don't want to sound like a prick but I'm constantly having the feeling that I'm learning from the best, it's such an enlightening experience that I wished that all coders out there had at least one time on their lives. </p>
<p>See you soon earthlings!</p>
