<p> My third week of outreachy was hard, there was Christmas and the notebook that I used to work died.</p> 
<p>In order to solve this problem I had two alternatives: an old dinosaur desktop and my parents chromebook. 
With the obituary of my old desktop in hands I had to hack my parents chromebook and let crouton reign.</p>
<p> I installed <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">crouton</a>, ubuntu 15.04 and gnome 3.14. In addition, I had to install jhbuild and build polari from scratch.
It was a painful task for me because the chromebook's hardware is weak and every step last ages.</p>
<p>Complications arose, ensued, were overcome. Now everything is up and running again and I'm ready to start to implement some fresh mockups! See you soon earthlings!</p>
